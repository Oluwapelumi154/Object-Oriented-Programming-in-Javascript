Object Oriented Programming is a style of Programming that focuses majorly on objects rather than functions.
In Object Oriented Programming we combine a group of related variables and function in an Object.

The 4-Concept of Object Oriented Programming are :
-- Encapsulation
-- Abstraction
-- Inheritance
-- Polymorphism

The term variables in the above explanation refers to the property of the Object
The term function in the above explanation is referred to as method in the Object

Note -- In javascript, object values can accessed using dot or bracket notation
In Object we have properties and method
-- A Propety is used to store value
-- A function or Method is used to define logic

Note -- Every function in an Object is referred to as Method

In Javascript we have :
-- Value or Primitive Types
-- Reference Types

Value or Primitive Types

--Number
-- string
-- boolean
-- symbol
-- undefined
-- null

Reference Types are

-- Objects
-- Array
-- function
